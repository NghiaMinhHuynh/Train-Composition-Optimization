# Train-Composition-Optimization

Overview

This code simulates a train consisting of different types of train cars, including engines, passenger cars, dining cars, and sleeping cars. The program provides functionality to create, manipulate, and analyze train compositions.

Testing

The program includes several test cases to verify the correctness of train car operations. These tests include:

Creating a simple train with different types of train cars.

Shipping freight cars with various constraints (e.g., minimum speed, maximum cars per train).

Usage
The train car simulation provides the following functionality:

Creating various types of train cars (engine, passenger car, dining car, sleeping car, and freight car).

Building a train by linking cars together.

Separating a train into two while optimizing the cost of operations.

Calculating statistics about the train composition, such as total weight, speed, average distance to the dining car, and closest engine to a sleeping car.
